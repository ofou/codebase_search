# Embedding Models in Machine Learning

Embedding models are a crucial component of modern natural language processing systems. They convert text, images, or other data into dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning.

## Popular Embedding Models

1. **Word2Vec**: One of the earliest popular word embedding techniques. It comes in two flavors:
   - Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW): Predicts the current word based on surrounding context
   - Skip-gram: Predicts surrounding context words given the current word

2. **GloVe (Global Vectors)**: Combines global matrix factorization and local context window methods to create word embeddings.

3. **BERT Embeddings**: Contextual embeddings from the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which considers the full context of a word in a sentence.

4. **Sentence Transformers**: Models specifically designed to create embeddings for entire sentences or paragraphs, not just individual words.

5. **OpenAI Embeddings**: Models like text-embedding-ada-002 that create high-quality embeddings for various NLP tasks.

## Characteristics of Good Embeddings

- **Dimensionality**: Typically ranges from 100 to 1024 dimensions, balancing expressiveness and computational efficiency.
- **Semantic Similarity**: Similar concepts should have embeddings with high cosine similarity.
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Support for operations like "king - man + woman = queen".
- **Clustering**: Words or concepts in the same category should cluster together in the embedding space.

## Applications

Embedding models power many applications including:
- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems
- Document classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation

The quality of embeddings directly impacts the performance of downstream tasks in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
